##  `Robust geometric predicates (without the agonising pain)`

Evaluating "geometric predicates" (`orientation`, `incircle`, etc) using standard floating-point arithmetic is a well-known nightmare, with floating-point round-off errors leading to ambiguities, non-convergence, and program crashes. A standard remedy is to employ "exact" computation via multi-precision techniques; eliminating floating-point round-off errors through operations on arbitrary bit-length number types.

This package is a `C++` framework for the construction of such predicates; encapsulating <a href=https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~quake/robust.html>Jonathan Shewchuk's</a> seminal arbitrary precision library <a href=https://dl.acm.org/doi/book/10.5555/865018>*without the agonising pain*</a> of the original hand-rolled `C89` code.

This package aims to implement a "zero-overhead" abstraction; leveraging various `C++` template- and compile-time patterns to avoid run-time stack/heap manipulation or pointer indirection. Timing analysis suggests the new templated `C++` predicates perform favourably compared to the original hand-rolled `C89` implementation. 

The following predicates are currently available:
````
orient2d: orientation of 3 points in E^2, or a point wrt. a line.
bisect2d: orientation of point wrt. half-space in E^2.
bisect2w: orientation of point wrt. half-space in E^2 (weighted).
inball2d: point-in-circumball (Delaunay-Voronoi tessellations) in E^2. 
inball2w: point-in-ortho-ball (Regular-Laguerre tessellations) in E^2.

orient3d: orientation of 4 points in E^3, or a point wrt. a plane.
bisect3d: orientation of point wrt. half-space in E^3.
bisect3w: orientation of point wrt. half-space in E^3 (weighted).
inball3d: point-in-circumball (Delaunay-Voronoi tessellations) in E^3.
inball3w: point-in-ortho-ball (Regular-Laguerre tessellations) in E^3.

A simplified two-stage variation on <a href=https://doi.org/10.1007/PL00009321>Shewchuk's original arithmetic</a> is employed, adopting standard (fast!) floating-point approximations when results are unambiguous and falling back onto (slower) arbitrary precision evaluations as necessary to guarantee "sign-correctness". Semi-static filters are used to toggle between floating-point and arbitrary precision kernels. An optional third (intermediate) stage based on interval arithmetic is also available.

In addition to support for multi-precision expansions, a simplified "double-double" precision number type is also provided, enabling construction of geometric primitives with approximately twice the precision of standard floating-point evaluations.
